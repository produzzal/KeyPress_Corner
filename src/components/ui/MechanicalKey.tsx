          Why Choose Mechanical Keyboards?
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg md:text-xl mb-4 text-justify">
          Mechanical keyboards offer unparalleled typing experience, durability,
          and customization options. Unlike membrane keyboards, mechanical
          keyboards use individual mechanical switches for each key, providing
          tactile feedback and greater precision. This makes them an excellent
          choice for enthusiasts, gamers, and professionals who value accuracy
          and reliability in their daily tasks. The switches come in various
          types such as linear, tactile, and clicky, catering to different
          preferences. Additionally, mechanical keyboards are built to last,
          often withstanding tens of millions of keystrokes. The customization
          potential is immense, allowing users to personalize keycaps, switches,
          and layouts to create a truly unique and comfortable typing
          experience.
